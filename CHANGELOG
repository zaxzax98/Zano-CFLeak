## [2.1.0] – Major Feature Upgrade

### Added

#### 🌐 IPv6 Intelligence Support
- Full IPv6 (AAAA record) resolution alongside IPv4
- Detection of Cloudflare IPv6 ranges (7 official ranges)
- Separate Cloudflare status indicators for IPv4 and IPv6 results

#### 🔍 Advanced Multi-IP Discovery
- DNS resolution now returns **all associated IPs**, not just the first hit
- Each IP is individually evaluated against Cloudflare ranges
- Output structure:
  - `IPv4: [ip1, ip2, ip3]`
  - `IPv6: [ip1, ip2]`
- CSV exports use semicolon-separated values for multiple IPs

#### 📊 Real-Time Progress Tracking
- Live progress bar during subdomain enumeration using `tqdm`
- Displays:
  - Elapsed time
  - Estimated time remaining
  - Total scanned domains
  - Cloudflare-protected count
- Automatically disabled in quiet mode (`-q`)

#### ☁️ Dynamic Cloudflare IP Intelligence
- Automatic fetching of Cloudflare IP ranges from official endpoints:
  - `https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4`
  - `https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6`
- Smart fallback to embedded ranges if API is unreachable
- Runtime logging indicates data source (API vs fallback)

#### 📁 Multi-Format Reporting
- Supported output formats:
  - JSON (`-f json`)
  - YAML (`-f yaml`) – custom serializer (no external dependency)
  - CSV (`-f csv`)
  - Enhanced human-readable terminal output
- Structured reports with clear sections:
  - Origin IPs
  - Cloudflare-protected targets
  - Unresolved domains
  - Errors

#### 📚 Multi-Wordlist Support
- Load multiple wordlists via repeated `-w` flags
- Automatic merging and deduplication
- Individual logging for each loaded wordlist

#### 🔊 Verbosity & Output Control
- Verbose mode (`-v, --verbose`) shows all scan results
- Quiet mode (`-q, --quiet`) outputs only confirmed origin IPs
- Structured logging with verbosity levels

#### 🧠 Smart Root Domain Check
- Automatic resolution of the root domain before subdomain enumeration

#### 🧾 Scan Summary Report
End-of-scan statistics include:
- Total domains tested
- Non-Cloudflare (origin) IP count
- Cloudflare-protected domains count
- Unresolved domains
- Error count

#### 🧹 Wordlist Parsing Enhancements
- Supports inline comments (`#`)
- Automatically ignores empty lines

#### 🧩 Data Models & Typing
- `ResolveResult` dataclass with list-based IP storage
- Separate tracking for:
  - IPv4 / IPv6
  - Cloudflare vs non-Cloudflare IPs
- Computed properties for clean origin IP extraction
- `ScanReport` dataclass with serialization support
- Modular architecture:
  - `CloudflareIPRanges`
  - `ReportWriter`
  - `ZanoOriginIP` (core scanner)
  - `Colors`, `OutputFormat`

### Changed

#### 🏗️ Architecture Refactor
- Migrated from procedural code to a fully object-oriented design
- Encapsulated scanner state and configuration
- Clear separation of responsibilities (scan, detection, reporting)

#### 🔐 Cloudflare Detection Logic
- Improved IPv4 / IPv6 parsing with robust error handling
- Lazy-loading Cloudflare ranges for performance optimization

#### ⚠️ Error & Signal Handling
- Graceful handling of:
  - DNS timeouts
  - User interrupts
  - Encoding issues
- Cleaner executor shutdown with future cancellation

#### ⚡ Performance Tuning
- Reduced request delay from `0.1s` → `0.05s`

#### 🎨 Output Enhancements
- Unified display of IPv4 + IPv6 results
- Color-coded Cloudflare indicators
- Clear labeling for protected vs origin infrastructure

#### 📖 Documentation
- Comprehensive module-level and class-level docstrings
- Clear tool purpose and ethical usage notes

---

### Removed

- Deprecated global variables (state is now instance-based)
- Legacy `os` usage (fully migrated to `pathlib`)
- Inline color constants (centralized in `Colors` class)

---

### Technical Improvements

#### 🧪 Code Quality
- Executable shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
- UTF-8 enforced file handling
- Optimized wordlist handling using `set` + sorted output

#### 📦 Dependencies
- `requests` – Cloudflare IP intelligence
- `tqdm` – progress visualization
- Native modules: `csv`, `json`, `datetime`, `dataclasses`, `enum`

#### 🖥️ CLI Enhancements
- Improved help formatting
- Real-world usage examples in CLI help
- Clearer argument descriptions
